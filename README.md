# Omamori
![Omamori Pixelart](general/Images/Omamori.png)



Omamori is a solar-powered LED pendant for necklaces.
I have got the motivation to realize this project during my time in university, when I first designed PCBs, even though I had the idea for much longer.
At first, I was using Altium Designer, which was used by my university. Later in Version 2.0 I switched to KiCad, which is a gem of software, which was recommended to me by Andreas (Thank you!).
Thank you as well for helping me with the soldering and designing, Andreas and Markus.
